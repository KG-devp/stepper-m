Me and my team are doing project which needs stepper motor, load cell, servo motor and break beam sensor.
here, stepper motor, servo,loadcell everything will be connect to pico. and do the test in micropython.

so, my code stepper_motor_test.py file is used for running one stepper motor, 
and merge code is the combination of three stepper motors.
